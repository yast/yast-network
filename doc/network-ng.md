# Network NG

This document tries to describe the details of the network-ng data model and how all the pieces are
combined.

## Overall Approach

{Y2Network::Config} and other associated classes represent the network configuration in a backend
agnostic way. It should not matter whether you are using `sysconfig` files, NetworkManager or
networkd.

The systems' configuration is read using *configuration readers*, which are special classes which
implements the logic to find out the details and build a proper {Y2Network::Config} object. Once the
wanted modifications are performed to this configuration object, it could be written in the
filesystem by using a *configuration writer*.

                 +--------+             +---------+
    reader ----> | config | -- user --> | config' |----> writer
      ^          +--------+             +---------+        |
      |                                                    |
      |                     +--------+                     |
      +---------------------| system |<--------------------+
                            +--------+

Obviously, we should implement configuration readers and writers for whathever backend we would like
to support. At this point of time, only `Sysconfig` and `Autoinst` are supported.

## The Configuration Classes

{Y2Network::Config} offers and API to deal with network configuration, but it collaborates with
other classes.

* {Y2Network::InterfacesCollection}: this class holds a list of interfaces and offers a query API
  (e.g., find all the ethernet interfaces).
* {Y2Network::Interface}: keeps interfaces information. There are three kind of interfaces at this
  point of time: physical, virtual and fake (physical but not present) ones.
* {Y2Network::ConnectionConfig}: describes a configuration that can be applied to an interface.
  Currently it is bound to an interface name, but we plan to provide more advanced matchers.
* {Y2Network::Routing}: holds routing information, including IP forwarding settings, routing tables, etc.

## Backend Support

In order to support a new backend, we need to implement a configuration readers and writers. The
{Y2Network::Sysconfig} module implements support to deal with `sysconfig` files.

    src/lib/y2network/sysconfig
    ├── config_reader.rb <- READER
    ├── config_writer.rb <- WRITER
    ├── connection_config_reader_handlers
    │   ├── eth.rb
    │   ├── wlan.rb
    │   └── ...
    ├── connection_config_reader.rb
    ├── dns_reader.rb
    ├── dns_writer.rb
    ├── interface_file.rb
    ├── interfaces_reader.rb
    ├── interfaces_writer.rb
    └── routes_file.rb

As you can see, there are many classes, but the relevant ones are just `ConfigReader` and `ConfigWriter`.

## Accessing the Configuration

The `Yast::Lan` module is still the entry point to read and write the network configuration. Basically, it keeps two configuration objects, one for the running system and another want for the wanted configuration.

    Yast.import "Lan"
    Yast::Lan.read(:cache)
    system_config = Yast::Lan.system_config
    yast_config = Yast::Lan.yast_config
    system_config == yast_config # => true
    # let's change IP forwarding settings
    yast_config.routing.forward_ipv4 = !system_config.routing.forward_ipv4
    system_config == yast_config # => false
    # write the new configuration
    Yast::Lan.Write

Any change you want to apply to the running system should be performed by modifying the
`yast_config` and writing the changes.

## AutoYaST Support

AutoYaST is somehow and special case, as the configuration is read from the profile instead of the
running system. So in this scenario, YaST2 Network will read the configuration using the `Autoinst`
reader and will write it to the final system using the one corresponding to the wanted backend.

## Current Status
