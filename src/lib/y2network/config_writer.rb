  # This class is responsible for writing the configuration to the system
  #
  # It implements a {#write} method which receives a configuration object and
  # apply the changes to the system. Moreover, it is possible to write partial
  # configurations (the so-called 'sections'). For example, you might want to
  # just write the DNS configuration but keep the rest as it is.
  #
  # It is expect that a configuration writer exists for each supported backend
  # by inheriting from this class. It implements support for the common bits:
  # drivers, intefaces (udev rules), DNS and hostname settings. Of course, you are
  # not forced to use this class as a base.
